      "body": "The guidance recommend that server generated connection IDs should include a crytographic MAC when being used for load balancing. This sounds like a good suggestion in principal, but the Connection ID is 64bits in size, I'm not a cryptographer but I don't see how this is possible - if it is possible then it perhaps would be good to include guidance within the documents?\r\n\r\nMy logic is as follows (hopefully I've made a mistake/misunderstood the concept somewhere)\r\n\r\nAs a CDN operator I'd probably want to segment the connection ID into 4 spaces:\r\nPOP id|machine id|unique connection|MAC\r\n\r\nYou could combine your POP id and machine ID into a single space but it is likely to be beneficial to have two tiers, the POP routes the request to the right general location and the machine id then identifies a machine within that space. Other ways to split this are also possible.\r\n\r\nIf 12 bits are used for POP id that would give 4096 distinct locations. Trends to deploy deeper into networks (particularly within mobile/cell base stations) doesn't make this number totally infeasible .\r\nIf 8 bits are then used for a machine id within a POP that gives 256 possible machines. \r\n\r\nThis means 20 bits might be used for load balancing purposes. This gives a bit (lot?) of room for flexibility and it is unlikely all million combinations are used but it is probably the right order of magnitude for a large widely distributed CDN (even if we drop down to 16 bits it doesn't significantly impact the analysis below).\r\n\r\nThe actual unique connection pool needs to be large enough to avoid repeating too quickly - even if you have a lot of clients taking advantage of 0RTT to aggressively close/re-open connections. There also presumably needs to be some randomization of the ids so that they aren't created sequentially. I've assumed 24 bits (which is only 16 million unique ids per server).\r\n\r\nThis only leaves 20 bits left for the MAC, that is about 1 million possible values. As I've said I'm not a cryptographer but to me this looks small enough that a brute force attack guided by some valid inputs might be feasible even on relatively low power machines? \r\n\r\nFor that matter isn't a simple replay attack feasible? The MAC can't be based upon the full 5-tuple as we need to support connection mobility. You could embed a timestamp into the id somewhere to protect against this but that would use up even more bits, otherwise you could slowly gather up valid (but presumably closed) connection ids and then aggressively replay them all in a short time period.",

The only reason I see to have a MAC at all is to make it harder for an attacker to mount an effective attack on a single backend using your routing infrastructure for steering.  QUIC as a protocol is resilient to man-on-a-side attack vector (except during handshake), so attackers guessing valid connection IDs is not a big deal.\r\n\r\nThe key is to have enough entropy (\"unique connection\" size) so you do not accidentally create duplicate connection IDs.\r\n\r\nYou may also want to include at least a bit that identifies the key used (since you'll want to do key rotation).",

Using Alt-Svc, the server is able to pick and advertise any port number and a compliant client will handle it just fine. That's already the case, and isn't part of this issue. #424 updates the HTTP draft to highlight this, increasing the odds that implementations will test and support that case.\r\n\r\nThis issue is to track that it might actually be desirable from a privacy standpoint for servers to pick arbitrary port numbers and perhaps even rotate them periodically (though that requires coordination with their Alt-Svc advertisements and lifetimes, which could be challenging) in order to make it more difficult for a network observer to classify traffic (and therefore more difficult to ossify).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as we're wrestling with in each of these privacy/manageability debates, removing easy network visibility into the likely protocol by using arbitrary port numbers means that middleboxes will probably resort to other means of attempting to identify protocols and potentially doing it badly, which could result in even worse ossification. (E.g. indexing into the TLS ClientHello to find the ALPN list, then panicking on a different handshake protocol.)\r\n\r\nThere's further discussion on the original issue, but this belongs in the ops drafts, not the protocol drafts.",

This seems like good operational advice for servers with enough traffic to build such anonymity sets (should they have interest in preventing client linkability, of course) -- small servers are probably out of luck though.\r\n\r\nApplicability should call this out as a problem, manageability should suggest a solution space.",

If it does so, it would be important that's it's both conformant to IETF specifications and have good performance.  This is the full L7 termination case, which is possible, but a lot of work, and we should heavily encourage anyone doing this to use an existing(\"good\") implementation.\r\n\r\nA potential MITM option is to attempt to terminate the handshake, but then only observe ApplicationData packets.  However, this could go wrong in many ways, so I believe it should be strongly discouraged.  QUIC is designed as an end-to-end protocol and efforts to change that are likely to end very poorly.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the length of the CID changes, then the offset of the header changes and a middlebox who doesn't track all CIDs both peers may be unable to decrypt packets.  I'm sure there are more gotchas, particularly with the introduction of extensions.  It may also be worth pointing out that QUIC frames are not TLV, so any frames(ie: extensions) that are not understood cause all other frames to be unparseable.\r\n\r\nThanks to @DavidSchinazi for the specific examples of ways this could fail.",

For example, client A and client B could share the same serverside address and port and the NAT can initially distinguish between the two because they have different CIDs.

The paper you link to here (from ICWET, and itself a decade old) primarily deals with the separation of good from bad flows at layer 7, not necessarily how the front-end handles these flows once classified. But you're definitely right that this is not *only* how it works: the DoS mitigation landscape is wide and varied (even if at the end of the day the only strategy we have found to work at scale is \"eat the DoS\".\r\n\r\nThat said, this text could be improved: it discounts detection and classification mechanisms other than based on flow designators derived from passive measurement, does not mention protocols other than IPFIX and the flow model that comes along with it when classifying traffic, etc. \r\n\r\nThe text should also be more applicable to UDP reflection DoS, which is a primary concern in wire image differentiation in QUIC (and which also isn't otherwise addressed in the document or in this issue). Adding a path-observable SYN cookie equivalent to QUIC, while useful, seems difficult to achieve given the working group's history of consensus about path-observable wire image features, so other classification mechanisms are what we'll be left with.\r\n\r\n",

While the infrastructure impact of QUIC is itself an intriguing research topic, DDoS affects not only transit networks but also the endpoints in ways that could not be prevented with any passive flow classification.",

To give an example, a CDN operator may have QUIC and HTTP endpoints that are configured differently according to customer configuration. With QUIC v1 it is safe to assume only TLS 1.3 so a CDN might not provide configuration for TLS version. However, other HTTP versions could theoretically be configured only to support a maximum of TLS 1.2. Since plaintext HTTP and TLS 1.2 are not prohibited for use on the internet, it seems odd to levy a requirement that prevents them being used in one specific chain of interactions. \r\n\r\nMirja's suggestion to say \"TLS over TCP\" is better but would still not address the plaintext HTTP case. A user agent might see http://example.com, connect to port 80, and get Alt-Svc'd to HTTP/3. If the something goes wrong and TLS is not permitted, then all connectivity might be broken forever.\r\n",

(The issue is copied from the QUIC WG list).\r\n\u201cEven thought this bit is fixed in the QUICv1 specification,\u201d\r\n-  This seems like the wrong word: /thought/though/\r\n---\r\n\u201cobservers cannot reliably use\u201c\r\n-Maybe we could avoid \u201creliably\u201d, e.g.:\r\n /cannot depend on this bit as/...\r\n---\r\n\u201cfirst octet in the short packet header.\u201d\r\nwould probably benefit from an indication of bit ordering and cross-reference to the QUIC spec.\r\n---\r\nSect 2.4: \u201cIn the nominal case\u201d - this use of \u201cnominal\u201d was unusual to me, the word is used differently in different English-speaking regions - in some it might mean \u201cmarginal\u201d or only correct at the current time - in other regions it might mean something else. Is \u201cnormal\u201d acceptable in this sentence?\r\n---\r\nSection 2.3: \u201cWe therefore consider\u201d - who is the \u201cwe\u201d, suggest something like \u201cThese are considered...\u201d\r\n---\r\n\u201cin the clear\u201d - would be simpler as \u201cwithout encryption\u201d or \u201cobservable on-path\u201d?\r\n---\r\nThe term \u201cexposes\u201d is used several times, without saying to whom, which I think in the context of this document, could be clearer as \u201cexposes this, making it visible to an on-path observer\u201d. Also this form of wording is consistent with sect 2.7. This also could help explain this in a more positive light to someone wishing to manage a network.\r\n---\r\nSect 2.4: \u201cThe amount of 0-RTT protected data is limited by the initial congestion window, typically around 10 packets [RFC6928].\u201d\r\n- I suggest this should instead be reference to a section in the QUIC spec. (This does in turn point to 6928, but I think the dependency here is on what QUIC says.)\r\n---\r\nSect 2.8\u201d: ...\u201dany manipulation of ... will be detected\u201d\r\nI think the word \u201cmanipulation\u201d hints like it is illicit, can we use neutral language by saying something like \u201cany change by network devices on-path\u201d?\r\n---\r\nSect 3.1: \u201cFirst, it only provides one bit of information and is quite prone to collide with UDP-based protocols other than those that this static bit is meant to allow multiplexing with.\u201c\r\nThis seems to lack a little polish (\u201cquite prone\u201d, \u201cmeant to ...with\u201d).\r\n---\r\nSect 3.3.1.\r\n/through passive measurement/by observation by an on-path observer/\r\n... I think this applies, whether it is measurement, filtering, whatever, so we could use the same term.\r\n---\r\n/which each one byte of zeros/ ... seems an odd set of words to me.\r\n---\r\nSection 4.1: \u201cKeying state off the connection ID may therefore cause undetectable and unrecoverable loss of state in the middle of a connection.  Use of connection ID specifically discouraged for NAT applications.\u201d\r\n... I didn\u2019t find /Keying state/ very helpful... maybe some other words would be clearer. The second sentence seems to miss /is/?\r\n---\r\nSect 4.6: \u201c Distinguishing ACK packets is trivial in TCP,\u201c\r\n- well, this is not really trivial, because there are pure ACKs and data+ACK which makes this complicated. RFC3449 says more.\r\n---",

      "body": "The manageability draft aims to provide guidance to network operators in managing QUIC traffic, yet currently says nothing about what could be a major impact for some networks.\r\n\r\nConsider a cellular/mobile network that is providing internet access to end users. Because it is an internet access service, the users have an implicit expectation that the complete range of internet packet sizes (i.e. up to 1500 bytes) can be exchanged. And as it is a cellular network packets are routinely encapsulated in GTP-U. The network operator also chooses to add IPSEC encapsulation in order to secure communications over a diverse range of connectivity providers. Since at least some of that connectivity is over paths with 1500 MTU, it implies that end-user datagrams over a certain size (e.g. 1400) would have to be fragmented at the point of encapsulation, and reassembled before delivery to the user.\r\n\r\nSuch fragmentation and reassembly comes at a cost. Importantly it implies a limited capacity for packets with sizes in the relevant range (e.g. 1400-1500). In a world where TCP dominates this is easily managed with MSS Clamping, so that both TCP endpoints learn the optimal size to use. In QUIC a different mechanism is required. QUIC-TRANSPORT describes how the endpoints can discover a hard path MTU limit, i.e. one where there is a clear cutoff above a certain size. I think the manageability draft needs a section that advises operators of networks where there is a soft path MTU limit. I'll create a PR with proposed wording for this section.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is unconvinced about the need for such packet size limitation, happy to discuss in more depth.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In a cellular network this pattern can arise:\r\n![Fragmentation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56736263/107362466-b2c61580-6ad0-11eb-8e2f-751d012a9a0d.jpg)\r\nBecause the IPSEC gateway acts on a packet that is already encapsulated, it naturally looks at the lower-layer IP header rather than the user's original IP header that had the DF bit set. Furthermore even if it performed deeper inspection and was able to take note of the DF, it would not have the ability to generate ICMP towards the server.\r\n\r\nThe second is the customer expectation reason. Clearly we could configure a router upstream of the PGW to have a lower MTU interface towards the PGW. This would force the router to drop the largest packets if they had DF set. And if they didn't set it, they would be fragmented (for v4). For mainstream internet services this would be ok, and few would notice. But with a large customer base, it is extremely likely that somebody will have a service that fails to work over such a network. At the end of the day people are paying for a \"normal\" internet service, and at least some of them will expect 1500 byte packets to be deliverable. Would you be happy for your home internet to be one that could never support packets larger than 1400 bytes?",

That's why we have PMTU discovery methods. I note GTP is not alone in wishing take-on support for a larger PMTU. Many layer 2's also transparently fragment, but this isn't something that the IETF should advocate per protocol (even though TCP-MSS clamping works in cases for instance when IPsec isn't used).   \r\n\r\nI don't see any specific need for anything in QUIC, or in guidance for QUIC. This is an IP-layer decision. A tunnel/encaps needs to support the MTU that it offers. Documenting the ways in which this can happen has been a long saga in the IETF: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-intarea-tunnels-10.\r\n\r\n",

However I do like the recognition that in ICMP there's no way to say \"bigger than I'd like, but I can deal with if needed\". That is essentially the problem here. We have a network that can handle large packets up to a certain percentage of the traffic (because it provides the necessary mechanisms), but it can't do that for the entire web.\r\n\r\nSo if I'm understanding you correctly, a network that does not want to carry all port 443 at 1500 bytes should handle this by using PMTU discovery methods to guide senders appropriately. That is essentially what I'm proposing in the PR.\r\n\r\nWhy is this particularly, uniquely, relevant to QUIC? Because HTTP is the bulk of internet traffic today, and clients and servers have incentives to adopt HTTP/3. This will radically alter the present ratio of TCP:UDP, and all such networks with reassembly capacity limits will benefit from a warning that their existing TCP MSS clamping will no longer protect them.",

The solution was to switch back to the original handshake MTU after a certain period of black-holing, which avoided the connection failing.\r\n\r\nHowever, when this was more widely enabled, we saw:\r\n 1) Complaints from operators who couldn't handle the excess traffic at higher MTUs\r\n 2) User visible issues(app-level timeouts) on some ISPs\r\n\r\nThis was the most user-visible issue I can recall our deployment having in the last few years, and it was completely unexpected, at least for me, because I was unaware of this 'can handle large packets up to a certain percentage of the traffic' form of network operations.

If the application requires certain data to be received in order, that data should be sent on the same stream. If there is a logical grouping of data chunks or messages, streams can be reused, or a new stream can be opened for each chunk/message. If one message is mapped to a single stream, resetting the stream to expire an unacknowledged message can be used to emulate partial reliability on a message basis. If a QUIC receiver has maximum allowed concurrent streams open and the sender on the other end indicates that more streams are needed, it doesn't automatically lead to an increase of the maximum number of streams by the receiver. Therefore it can be valuable to expose maximum number of allowed, currently open and currently used streams to the application to make the mapping of data to streams dependent on this information.\r\n\r\nThat's a lot to work through.  Consider breaking this up a little.  I see a few things:\r\n\r\n1. Concurrency is aided by using more streams where ordering is not necessary or where concurrency is desirable.\r\n2. On the opposite end of things, streams provide ordering where ordering is critical.\r\n3. Sending a message per stream allows messages to be cancelled.\r\n4. Limits on concurrency need to be accounted for.",

On the plus side, it's something that benefits from the same techniques as SNI (and less likely to cause deployment issues, though that is only because we haven't ossified around it as much).\r\n\r\nAs for the general point about now vs. later.  One of the things we've tried to do is be very clear about what the invariants are, or what promises we are making.  It's not the same thing as true ossification defense, but if we make it clear what we are committing to, maybe we won't have people relying on stuff we might want to change.",

          "body": "The structure of the argument here is a bit stilted.\r\n\r\nYou want to start with the problem: UDP, middleboxes, short timers, connections become unusable.  Then, explain that QUIC provides PING, a mechanism that allows endpoints to test if a path is live and - where there are middleboxes with state that is refreshed by activity - keep any state in the path alive.\r\n\r\nThen you can say that this is extremely expensive if pinging is constant.  Mention bandwidth and also cost to battery-powered devices where maintaining an open radio channel is energy-intensive.\r\n\r\nNote then that it might be appropriate to limit use of keep-alives, but that will depend on application.  In HTTP, the recommendation is to only use them when there are outstanding requests.  At other times, allowing connections to time out or shutdown is preferable.  Then note that - with 0-RTT - the latency impact of opening a new connection is not that high.\r\n\r\nYou start and end with comments about keep-alives being application-specific.  That's not really the key point here.  You are simply trying to explain what the constraints are.  By making this your book-end statements, you shift a ton of emphasis onto the point, when it is really just a consequence of understanding the constraints you operate under.  Concentrate on documenting those constraints first and foremost, and then explain what options are available.",

Instead, applications which use QUIC can specify a port number to represent the combination of that application protocol and the QUIC transport, if desired.  Using the same port number that the application uses over TCP can be a useful mnemonic in some cases.",

Namely, avoid blocking a random fraction of UDP packets and, instead, focus on either blocking all packets from a subset of users or none at all.\r\n\r\nThis is related to areas discussed in #93.",

          "body": "There's no mention of the QUIC Retry mechanism here. At the very least, for long header packets, a cooperating DDoS protection device can maintain a white-list of peer IP addresses, and only let through those addresses that successfully go through the Retry scenario.\r\n\r\nThe question then is what to do with short header packets. The backend server will not have any connection state for any junk short header packets, so the server should either quickly discard the packet silently or send a stateless reset if it happens to look like a valid QUIC packet. Assuming the short header packet traffic is enough to overwhelm the server, then this PR's text would come into play. Though it'd be interesting to see some perf numbers on what kind of CPU cost there is to just reject these packets. From my previous tests with the QUIC server running in the Windows kernel, the network was the limiting factor in these type of attacks, not the CPU. So if the network is the bottleneck, does it really matter if you drop it at the server or just in front of it?",

I am happy to give it a try in a different PR, or I can leave it to you, since you've likely thought more about this topic. The cooperation should include an agreement on the format of the Token to:\r\n1. For a Retry tokens generated by DDoS protection device, decode original_destination_connection_id.\r\n1. DDoS protection device to understand and validate server's token provided by a NEW_TOKEN frame\r\n1. DDoS protection device to understand and validate server's Retry tokens\r\n\r\nAs for the CPU cost, this consideration only comes into play, if the attack was allowed to reach backend servers.  Volumetric DDoS can saturate network links and/or be targeting networking infrastructure and not just backend servers.  As @britram is saying in #93, volumetric attacks are often mitigated further away from the edge of the network.  This kind of mitigation is the focus of UDP Policing section.",

It doesn't retransmit it because the keys are gone.

Using ECMP to distribute packets from a single flow across multiple network paths could produce similar effects.   These variations could adversely affect performance.\r\n\r\nThe improved feedback in QUIC relative to TCP might mean that QUIC is more able to tolerate variations in packet delivery.  There are also opportunities to deploy loss detection and congestion control algorithms that are more aware of these, but these algorithms do not currently exist.\r\n\r\nGetting differential treatment might be better served by using independent connections, but this has other effects, such as increased overheads and competing congestion control.",

Two points: first using _some kind of_ congestion control and recovery is not optional and all of these algorithms have to assume that all packets take the same path/get the same treat because otherwise you will need multiple congestion controller instances and that's not some we have in QUICv1. And second, algorithms do exist. TCP RACK is more re-ordering resilience and the time-based threshold in QUIC is as well. My assumption was/is also that they will more likely be implemented/used/deployed in QUIC than in TCP. \r\n\r\nHowever, we should probably see if we agree what we want to recommend. I think the right thing to recommend is that you should only use one DCSP with one QUIC connection and if you think you need more than one DCSP for your traffic, you should use multiple QUIC. Not sure if @martinthomson agrees to the second part?\r\n\r\nI was also trying to specifically focus this section on DCSP and EMCP (and not QoS in general to much - see new section title) because that the kind of questions I heart.",

However, I'm wondering why you need to condition this on the protocol being QUIC.\r\n\r\nGood question. I think it'd be unwise to take this action (drop & send ICMP) blindly without regard to how the transport protocol will react. UDP of course carries a diverse set of services, and not all of them will react well to this. If all implementations complied with RFCs there should be no issue; a DF bit set means the sender is expecting it might have to deal with drops. Hopefully they have tested that it works gracefully.\r\n\r\nBut from a sense of caution I prefer to take the approach that such actions should be targetted on services where we have more confidence that it will react well. The finalised QUIC is one such transport, and significantly it's one that will carry the majority of internet traffic before long.",

However, I'm wondering why you need to condition this on the protocol being QUIC.\r\n\r\nI find @chris-box's reasoning pretty convincing.\r\n\r\nThe on path equipment is already taking different approaches based on the transport protocol (i.e. MSS clamping with TCP) and allowing some existing protocols to be fragmented. QUIC being treated as the latter category is obviously problematic, so the operator has two choices that would allow DPLPMTUD to function for QUIC:\r\n\r\n1. Stop doing any sort of fragmentation.\r\n2. Make a best effort attempt to not fragment QUIC packets and rather drop them on the floor. \r\n\r\nThe former is likely to disrupt some protocols which are functioning \"fine\" today with fragmentation and reassembly, which may make it untenable for an operator. The latter, while not totally straightforward and smells of ossification, seems like it would be more tenable in practice while addressing the actual issue.",

The relevant sentence for me from quic-transport is \"Datagrams containing Initial packets MAY exceed 1200 bytes if the sender believes that the network path and peer both support the size that it chooses.\" In the general case, from where does that belief arise? In starting at 1330 (which I assume is the v6 size) it would work fine on the EE network but it would fail in traversing a network with the IPv6 minimum MTU. Are you relying on successful PMTU discovery from the INITIAL packet to catch that situation?",
